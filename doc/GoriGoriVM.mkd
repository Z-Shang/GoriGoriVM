# Introduction
GoriGoriVM is designed as a VM that is derived from the SECD machine, the main difference is that GoriGoriVM is polymorphically typed (in System-F's way).

# Instructions
As we all know, instructions of SECD are:

> I ::= var x | (\lambda x.C) | App

where as in GoriGoriVM:

> I ::= var x \epsilon t | \Lambda t . \lambda x \epsilon T.C |
